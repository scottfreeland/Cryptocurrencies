# Cryptocurrencies

The purpose of this analysis is to analyze a database of various crytocurrencies, utilizing the means of unsupervised machine learning. The idea is to help discover trends in order to help convince an investment firm to invest in these new currencies.

## Resources
- Data sources: crypto_data.csv
- Software: Jupyter Notebook: 6.3.0, Visual Studio Code, 1.60.2

## Results
The two major facets of enacting unsupervised learning is first cleaning the data, then second, applying machine learning algorithms to reveal various trends that exist among the data.

So, first, I cleaned the data. Unsupervised machine learning requires all data be of numerical form - No strings. Additionally, feeding our algorithms only the most crucial, impactful measurements and no superfluous data is integral to finding successful outcomes via unsupervised machine learning. After cleaning the initial data, I was left with only the most relevant and applicable data I could apply to machine learning. This is what I set out to work with.
